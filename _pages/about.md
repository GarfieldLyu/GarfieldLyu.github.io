I am a last-year PhD candidate at the [Web Information System](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl), TU Delft, under the guidance of [Avishek Anand](https://www.avishekanand.com). My research is focused on bringing interpretability to complex deep learning models, in diverse domains including information retrieval, natural language processing, tabular and image data applications. 

I obtained my MSc degree with excellence (ausgezeichnet) in Computer Science, specialised in Internet Technologies and Information Systems, from [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/), Germany in Apr 2018. Before that, I completed my BSc degree in Computer Science from [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn), China. 
After my master graduation, I worked as a research assistant in [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de), Germany until March 2021. For the work, I developed my knowledge and explored the research field in deep learning and natural language processing, particularly sequence-to-sequence learning.
